# Data Science Challenge : Customer Churn PredictionðŸ“±
Welcome to my project for the [Data Science Challenge organized by Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-challenge) In this challenge, I was taking on real-world problem that is critical to many industries: predicting customer churn.

## ðŸ¤” Project Introduction
Subscription services are leveraged by companies across many industries, from fitness to video streaming to retail. One of the primary objectives of companies with subscription services is to decrease churn and ensure that users are retained as subscribers. In order to do this efficiently and systematically, many companies employ machine learning to predict which users are at the highest risk of churn, so that proper interventions can be effectively deployed to the right audience.

## ðŸš€ My Journey
I started by exploring the data, finding key patterns that were important for predicting churn. After cleaning and preparing the data, I built and improved models with stacking classifier being particularly effective. By fine-tuning the models, I was able to boost the ROC AUC score. I also used SHAP to better understand which features were driving the predictions.

All of these led my submission ranked to a ```top 5%``` finish in the competition. achieving a score of 75.09% compared to the median score of 67.26%. This impressive result placed me among the ```top 95th percentile``` of competitors! ðŸŽ‰ You can view [ChurnPrediction.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/chabiw1/Churn-Prediction-Challenge/blob/main/ChurnPrediction.ipynb) that showing a EDA and good mix of technical skills and strategy and my profile on the [Coursera website](https://www.coursera.org/account-profile).

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact:
- Provided actionable insights into customer churn, allowing businesses to target at-risk subscribers more effectively.
- Enhanced model interpretability with SHAP, offering clear explanations of feature contributions, which supports strategic decision-making.
- Improved the ability to retain subscribers by identifying key factors influencing churn, leading to more effective retention strategies and potentially increased revenue.
